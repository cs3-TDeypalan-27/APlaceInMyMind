			<h1> A Place In My Mind </h1>
			<h2> BY: Therese Deypalan </h2>
				<div> 
					<h4> Today is one of those sad days </h4> 
					<h4> So I went to one familiar place </h4>
					<h4> A safe place to show my fears </h4>
					<h4> As my eyes slowly fill up with tears </h4>
					<h4> I finally felt the comfort that I really needed right here </h4>
					
					<h4> Then that voice approached me and said </h4>
					<h4> "Its time to leave this paradise" </h4>
					<h4> The clouds slowly clattered my head </h4>
					<h4> Reality came to me and I realized </h4>
					<h4> I was just back in my room again </h4>
